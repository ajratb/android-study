== Introduction

//A paragraph followed by an unordered list{empty}footnote:[AsciiDoc supports unordered, ordered, and description lists.] with square bullets.footnote:[You may choose from square, disc, and circle for the bullet style.]

To view the files for specific version, i.e. everything that was done on previous versions plus on this version, you can just checkout the tag **v#** where **#** - is the version number. For example:

[square]
* `git clone git@github.com:ajratb/android-study.git` - cloning the repository
* `cd android-study` - changing directory to project one
* `git checkout v1.3 -b branch_1.3` - getting files for version 1.3 in a separate branch with name _branch_1.3_

//  text 'Hello, World!'
//end

//== Conclusion
